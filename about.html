                <h2>A Deeper Look into My Journey</h2>

                    <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/a424c671-d40d-4172-b77e-5d28d867cf59/image%201.png.jpg?v=1749305984396" alt="Your Profile Picture" class="profile-img">
                    <p>Hello! I'm Savija, currently a university student. My studies are primarily focused on the Sciences, and I have a deep passion for subjects like Space Science and Astronomy. The vastness of the cosmos, its intricate workings, and the endless possibilities of discovery have captivated my imagination from a young age, leading me down a path of continuous learning and exploration.</p>

                    <p>While my primary focus is on scientific studies, I'm also on a continuous learning curve in the realm of Information Technology (IT). Although I may not possess extensive prior knowledge in IT, my strong interest in 'web design and coding' has driven me to explore this domain. This website itself is a testament to that journey â€“ a learning project where I've challenged myself to bring my visions to life through code. I understand there might be minor imperfections, but I hope you'll see them as part of my growth and dedication.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why "Cosmic Seeker"? My Purpose and Passion</h3>
                    <p>I created "Cosmic Seeker" for a few key reasons. Firstly, it serves as my personal digital repository to easily collect, organize, and preserve the knowledge and insights I gather. More importantly, it's a platform for personal growth and continuous self-challenge. I strive to outdo myself every day, pushing the boundaries of my creativity and technical skills.</p>
                    
                    <p>This website is designed as a "Knowledge Hub" that transcends personal archiving. It compiles rich information primarily focused on Space Science and Biology. My aim is to make complex scientific concepts accessible and engaging for a wider audience. While I might not delve into every minute detail, you can trust the accuracy of the data and clarity of the diagrams and visual content provided here, as they are sourced directly from reliable and reputable organizations.</p>

                    <p>For instance, delve into the cosmos through the data from the "NASA API" in my <a href="library.html#nasa-library-section">NASA Library</a>, offering genuine insights into astronomical phenomena, missions, and stunning visuals. Similarly, explore Earth's incredible biodiversity via the "GBIF API" in my <a href="library.html#gbif-library-section">GBIF Library</a>, providing accurate data on species occurrences and ecological patterns.</p>
                    
                    <p>You might wonder about other general knowledge sources. While platforms like Wikipedia offer vast information, and their images/videos are often readily downloadable, I emphasize that the factual content here, especially within the integrated libraries, is derived directly from trusted API sources, ensuring reliability that publicly editable platforms might not always guarantee.</p>

                    <p>My Creations: In addition to this scientific data, I have also included a few of my own creative designs in the gallery section. Feel free to explore them if you're interested, or simply navigate past them if they're not what you're looking for.</p>

                    <h3>Join Me on This Journey</h3>
                    <p>Ultimately, if you ever find yourself struggling to find accurate scientific information from various sources, I encourage you to use my **Science Portfolio**. It's built with the intention of being a reliable resource. I'm always eager to connect with fellow science enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone with a curious mind. Thank you for visiting, and I hope this website ignites your passion for discovery!</p>
